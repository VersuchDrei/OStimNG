hkanno tutorial by Distar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFwW9dVUZiE

annotations don't work with FNIS, if you want to use them you have to create a Nemesis patch
Nemesis patch tool: https://github.com/VersuchDrei/OStimBillyyThreesomePack/releases/tag/1.0

OStim registers a bunch of annotations in its Nemesis patch, some of them take parameters in the payload, others are just a simple annotation
